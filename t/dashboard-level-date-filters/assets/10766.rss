    <title>Dashboard Level Date Filters</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/dashboard-level-date-filters/10766</link>
    <description>Hi all, I&#39;m looking for some high level design feedback. I am working on a redash dashboard and I was hoping to have a dashboard-level filter that lets the user select what time period they want data from (i.e. only include data from the past 24 hours, or only include data from July 23-28, 2022, etc.) According to the [redash docs on query parameters](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/querying/query-parameters#Date-and-Date-Range-Parameters), dynamic dates and date ranges aren’t compatible with Scheduled Queries. So, I was thinking of having 2 sets of queries:

1. One set of queries would query the datasource (hive, redshift, ...) directly at a scheduled interval (once a day/week/month/ever).
2. A second set of queries would use [redash QRDS](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/querying/query-results-data-source) on the cached results of the first queries, with date range dashboard level filters

Is this a reasonable design? Would it take too long on the client-side? Would it be too computationally expensive? Any advice is appreciated</description>

            <p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>Yes that’s a reasonable design.</p>
<p>The time it takes on the client varies on how many rows there are. Keep in mind that Redash is a visualisation tool for <em>aggregated</em> data sets. It’s not meant to pull 1m or even 100k rows into your browser, although it can in some cases do that.</p>
<p>Give it a try and ping if you hit any blockers <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grin.png?v=12" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
