    <title>Hosted Redash EOL</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/hosted-redash-eol/9808</link>
    <description>I received an email suggesting that hosted Redash would be discontinued at the end of November 2020, with data being deleted 30 days after that.

I&#39;ve just logged in to my hosted Redash instance and can see that it&#39;s still up and running - could somebody please advise;

1. When will the data _actually_ be deleted?
2. Is there some way I can manually delete the data myself? (I have admin privileges on the instance).

Thanks!
