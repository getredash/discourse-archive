    <title>Failed data source test connection in Redash after upgrade from v8 to v10</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/failed-data-source-test-connection-in-redash-after-upgrade-from-v8-to-v10/11697</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary

I recently upgraded Redash from v8 to v10 and I was able to see the UI changes right away with the previous data from my v8 intact. However, as I was trying to test the datasource connection to our ClickHouse db via the user interface, it always fails and from inspecting the network, it returns 502 bad gateway.

So I tried connecting to the datasource from the redash (server) pod with the same connection URL, credentials, database name - and I was able to connect successfully.

### Technical details:

* Redash Version: v10
* Browser/OS: Chrome/Edge
* How did you install Redash: Kubernetes</description>
