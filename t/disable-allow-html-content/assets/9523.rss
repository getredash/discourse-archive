    <title>Disable Allow HTML content</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/disable-allow-html-content/9523</link>
    <description>Hi. 
Is it possible to disable Allow HTML content parameter by default on queries results?
I am using Redash with Clickhouse. In one of my columns I have html text. And when I was executing select query  from such column the html text was breaking the redash UI. If I save the query, disable manually Allow HTML content checkbox on that column, it works normally. But this is inconvenient a lot.
Is there any way to disable this setting by default? Perhaps with the help of the base, or in the source code ?
Thanks.
PS. I am using self-hosted docker Redash instance, the last version.</description>
