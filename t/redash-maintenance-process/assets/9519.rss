    <title>Redash Maintenance Process</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/redash-maintenance-process/9519</link>
    <description>Hi,

can anyone please help us to clarify the below points,
1. In Redash - Queries section, one can create any number of queries and archive those but one **cannot** delete the queries. So in that case, do the archived queries physical memory gets released or do they occupy some memory; how actually the memory management is working?
2. Is there any maintenance process/activity in Redash to optimize the redash&#39; server&#39;s memory and physical space?

please let us know if it is not clear.

thanks,</description>

<li>Correct. Redash does not delete query text. But query results for archived queries are cleaned-up with a periodic job. The text of a query requires so little memory there is virtually no savings to delete the queries completely. But a potentially large issue if a user mistakenly deletes a query and it cannot be recovered.</li>
<li>Redash does this automatically by clearing out unused query results from the database.</li>
</ol>
