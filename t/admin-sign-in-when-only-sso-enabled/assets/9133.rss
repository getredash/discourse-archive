    <title>Admin sign in when only SSO enabled</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/admin-sign-in-when-only-sso-enabled/9133</link>
    <description>Hi everyone !

We just set up a self hosted instance of Redash and we decided to only enable SSO via Google with restricted domain (and disable password sign in).
Everything is working fine for our employees (sign up/in/out) but for me, as an admin, I could connect to my admin account anymore. I kept a session logged in on my computer but whenever I need to connect from another laptop I can&#39;t.
I tried to connect with company Google email but as I already have an account with this address, it gives me a 500 internal error

Is there a specific URL to sign in as admin with login/pwd ? 
Do I need to enable sign in with password again ?

Thanks a lot in advance
