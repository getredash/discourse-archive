    <description>### Issue Summary
Post upgrading redash from v8.0 to v9.0 we are getting following error whenever any new user tries to login via google. Working fine for already existing users.

AttributeError: &#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;id&#39;
The debugger caught an exception in your WSGI application. You can now look at the traceback which led to the error.
To switch between the interactive traceback and the plaintext one, you can click on the &quot;Traceback&quot; headline. From the text traceback you can also create a paste of it. For code execution mouse-over the frame you want to debug and click on the console icon on the right side.
You can execute arbitrary Python code in the stack frames and there are some extra helpers available for introspection:
dump() shows all variables in the frame
dump(obj) dumps all that&#39;s known about the object
```

**NOTE** : This is happening for new users which are not created in users table.

### Technical details:

* Redash Version: v9.0
* Browser/OS: Ubuntu 16.04.4
* How did you install Redash: Git fork</description>
