    <title>Schema listing for Big data is not working</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/schema-listing-for-big-data-is-not-working/10014</link>
    <description>We are using Redash version 10 and Schema listing for Big data is not working properly, we have tried increasing container memory but this does not look like cost effective solution.

Therefore can we request a feature of paginated view of tables (...more) or can Redash in its python code retrieve the schema in an optimized way. 

Also we need to improve the miss rate and increase the cache TTL can you pls guide us with this configuration in Redash.

We see users click on refresh button more often does this refresh button query for new data or looks in cache, if doesn&#39;t look for records in cache can you pls guide us how we can prevent frequent data fetches.

Thanks for your active help and support on this issue!</description>
