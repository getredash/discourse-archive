    <title>Redash Request Response Flow</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/redash-request-response-flow/9729</link>
    <description>Hello Folks - I am changing behaviour in my backend presto gateway and while doing that i would like to test integration with that change. If there is any documentation which explains request response flow/structure from/to Redash - it would be really helpful.
Thanks in Advance.
-Salman

P.S. - basically I am trying to implement rate limiting at presto gateway so i wanted to understand what/how should I respond back from presto gateway itself rather than sending request to Presto such that I can stop overburdening Presto.</description>

            <p>thanks jesse for a reply -<br>
let me retry :<br>
I am using Redash with Presto as a data source. Also I am using Presto Gateway which sits in the middle of Redash and Presto gateway. Now I have implemented some logic (rate limiting) in the Gateway where I want to deny few New Query requests based on some logic. And when I deny a request I would like to make sure that I give a proper response (some sort of erro message) to Redash which can be displayed on UI. So I am looking for a way to send my response.</p>

            <p>Hi there and welcome to the forum <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wave.png?v=10" title=":wave:" class="emoji" alt=":wave:"></p>
<p>Do you mean the request/response flow between Redash and Presto? Or between the Redash Webapp and Redash server?</p>
<p>You can see exactly how Redash runs queries against presto by looking at its query runner code <a href="https://github.com/getredash/redash/blob/master/redash/query_runner/presto.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>The request response cycle between Redash and its webapp won’t have any affect on the rate limits on your presto gateway so I won’t cover it here.</p>
