    <title>Joining two sources</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/joining-two-sources/10200</link>
    <description>Hello all,

I have a question. I have two data sources:
- data from google analytics incl a ga_adwordsCampaignID
- data from a PBX with call information incl the same id (now called Adgroup_id)

What i do now: i make two queries on the two sources (query 9 and 11). I then want to join them using another query:
```sql
select * from query_9 as q1830
join query_11 as qga on q1830.Adgroup_id = qga.ga_adwordsCampaignID and date(date) =date(ga_date)
```

This kind of does what i want, BUT sometimes i have id&#39;s present in table 1 and not in table 2 and visa versa:

```
table1                 table2
id   col1    col2   id    col3    col 4
1    2         3    1     6       7
2    5         2
                    3     4       2
```

What i would like is the following result:

```

id   col1    col2     col3    col 4
1    2         3         6         7
2    5         2         0         0
3    0         0         4         2
```

Now i basically have data for every id and zeros for non existing ids in the corresponding query.
But the above query gives me:
```

id   col1    col2     col3    col 4
1    2         3         6         7
```
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>Hello Jesse, impressively enough that query works out of the box, but what happens now is that i have a lot of duplicates like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">date           numcalls       clicks
14/03/22 11:58  56             19
14/03/22 11:58  56             19
14/03/22 11:58  56             19
14/03/22 11:58  56             19
14/03/22 11:58  56             19
15/03/22 11:07  76             25
15/03/22 11:07  76             25
</code></pre>
<p>I wonder if this is coming from the union or from the LEFT JOIN?</p>
<p>UPDATE: Yes, it is definitely coming from the UNION. The problem is the ids are included many times in the GA data (multiple dates, etc). So all_ids contains ids like: 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,5,6,7,7,etc<br>
I tried adding a second WITH distinct_ids as () but that resulted in a syntax error (it was a long shot anyway). So my question really is: how can i make sure ids are only included once?</p>

            <p>Welcome to the forum! This question is more to do with SQLite than Redash specifically. The QRDS data source uses SQLite.</p>
<p>The problem is you’re using <code>JOIN</code> syntax, which only retrieves rows where the <code>id</code>s match. This will discard any rows on either table if the <code>id</code> doesn’t appear on <em>both</em> tables.</p>
<p>In most other databases you would use the <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code> syntax to include all the rows. But SQLite doesn’t support full outer joins. There is a workaround though. You’ll select all the data from both tables with a UNION statement, and then join both tables to this unioned table. There are a few ways to write it. I tried my best to make the query out of what you provided. Give this a try and see how it goes!</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sql">
WITH all_ids as (
SELECT Adgroup_id id FROM query_9
UNION ALL
SELECT ga_adwordsCampaignID id FROM query_11
)

SELECT * FROM all_ids
LEFT JOIN query_9 as q1830 ON all_ids.id = q1830.Adgroup_id
LEFT JOIN query_11 as qga ON all_ids.id = qga.ga_adwordsCampaignID and date(q1830.date) = date(qga.ga_date)
ORDER BY id
