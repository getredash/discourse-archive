    <title>What will happen at EOL</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/what-will-happen-at-eol/9400</link>
    <description>We are a current user of the Hosted Version of ReDash. We&#39;ve successfully managed to now host this ourselves and will wait for EOL. 

Do we need to do anything further for EOL? Can we actually suspend our Hosted Version earlier so we can confirm there are no hidden/unknown dependancies between ReDash Hosted and our own Hosted Versions?

Also at EOL, will billing just automatically stop?</description>
