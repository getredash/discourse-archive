    <title>How to identify currently-executing queries</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/how-to-identify-currently-executing-queries/10266</link>
    <description>We have a self-hosted, Dockerized Redash instance. How can I go about identifying currently-executing queries? 

I found some discussion here http://discuss.redash.io/t/users-running-queries-or-query-history/5122/2 about querying the DB or checking the audit logs. Is this still the recommended solution? If so, where do the audit logs live in the Dockerized environment?

Cheers and thanks!</description>
