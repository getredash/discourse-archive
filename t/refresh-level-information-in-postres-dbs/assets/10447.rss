    <title>Refresh level information in postres DB&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/refresh-level-information-in-postres-dbs/10447</link>
    <description>1/ Where does redash store **dashboard level refresh** and other settings ? I cant see it in dashboard postres table .
2/ Specifically we want to find the dashboards / widgets that re manually triggered by users for operational health and refreshes on delays/failing (not queue lenght)- but couldn&#39;t find it any of the postgres tables .

The reason this is important is that a lot of users report that their refreshes do not work - and we want to set up operational metrics to track what all refreshes failed at widgets/Dashboard level / what all failed at dashboard level. Currently, I couldn&#39;t find either.</description>
