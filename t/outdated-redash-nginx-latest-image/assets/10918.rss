    <title>Outdated redash/nginx:latest image</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/outdated-redash-nginx-latest-image/10918</link>
    <description>Hey everyone,

a recent PCI (security) check on our clients installation pointed to an outdated nginx version that redash uses in its docker image. I checked the docker-compose file and realized that the docker image used for nginx is &quot;redash/nginx:latest&quot;, which has a hardcoded nginx version in its env file:  nginx-1.9.10-1~jessie. 

Is there any chance that this could be upgraded on your end, or that you could allow us to override the variable via a custom env variable? 

I fear that more people may need to upgrade nginx for similar reasons.

Thanks &amp; Regards,
Paul</description>
