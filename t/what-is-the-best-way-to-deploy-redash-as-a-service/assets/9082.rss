    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/what-is-the-best-way-to-deploy-redash-as-a-service/9082</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary
Currently We are using docker-compose to deploy redash Along with custom fork(minor frontend changes) but recently started facing issues like worker getting queued etc. Moving forward we want to use redash as a service and deploy it as ECS containers. What would be the best way to follow this approach. Also is there any better approach to resolve the same **ex : ** Initially we were planning to use kubernetes arch. to deploy redash. Need advice on same.
A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs.

### Technical details:

* Redash Version: V9.0
* Browser/OS: Ubuntu 16.04
* How did you install Redash: Git clone</description>
