    <description>What is the status of new development on redash?  Its been 9 months since a release of a docker image.  There are 200+ PRs in GH.

Is there another project where resources are getting allocated?  Is Redash abandoned?

It looks like a great product, but easy-to-fix bugs are preventing people from being able to use it.

Thanks for any information.  I am interested in contributing.

            <p>I was going to ask the same question. I guess the official response can only be given by <a class="mention" href="https://discuss.redash.io/u/arikfr">@arikfr</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are obvious signs that can’t lie. <a href="https://github.com/getredash/redash/graphs/contributors" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">These</a> are the contributors analytics in Github. Very little work is being done.</p>
<p>It’s a shame because I love Redash, but it is what it is.</p>
