    <description>Is it possible to implement row level security in redash?

I have data stored in the following hierarchy mapping a user with clients in M:M relationship. Tables are below

1. clients(have all the clients under this table)
2. users
3. users_to_clients_mapping(stores information of user tagging to specific clients with m:m relationship)

Under clients we have data stored in following way,

clients --&gt; projects --&gt; tasks --&gt; assignee(each task has multiple assignees in m:m releationship)

Once a user logs in to the redash. I want to restrict user to view the data of the clients and the data under those clients in which he is tagged. If this is possible to do Please help me with some example on doing this. 

Thanks in Advance,
Amit M</description>

            <p>Redash won’t work for this use-case because Redash doesn’t work at this level. Row-level security is typically implemented at the <em>database</em>. Redash is there to visualise the data.</p>
