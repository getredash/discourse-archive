    <title>New release anytime soon?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/new-release-anytime-soon/11510</link>
    <description>I was going to get started with Redash but I noticed there has not been a new release cut in over a year.

I see there is plenty of commit history on the default branch on GitHub.

Is this project still active?</description>

<p>We are trying several products and we like redash.

            <p>Hello!<br>
It would be nice, if someone in charge could give an update about the future of redash. We are trying several products and we like redash. But we are unsure to use it, since we don’t know if there will be any product in future. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/confused.png?v=12" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Hi buddy,</p>
<p>I’m using Redash for the last 4 years, the active development decreased when Databricks bought Redash in 2020. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/confused.png?v=12" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Probably they are working on a paid version.</p>
