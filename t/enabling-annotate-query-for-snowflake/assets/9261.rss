    <title>Enabling annotate_query for Snowflake</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/enabling-annotate-query-for-snowflake/9261</link>
    <description>Hello!
We would like to annotate the queries for Snowflake (interested in user names/id/whatever particularly), as it is done for some databases.
However Snowflake&#39;s query runner does not seem to contain any calls to annotate_query.
Was it done intentionally for some reason?
Otherwise, WDYT on adding this? Can I provide a PR to get it sooner? Any hints?

Best regards,
Evgenii</description>
