    <description>Hi there,
I was wondering if there are some plans to add data documentation/catalog in future releases. My team uses Redash to prototype dashboards/reports on top of Data Lake data; It would be beneficial to have documentation for tables/columns in Redash without the need to roll out additional services like Amundsen or DataHub.</description>
