            <p>Redash queries that are scheduled to run are going into the “outdated queries”.<br>
<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13073690/59371379-785c1200-8d0a-11e9-9fcb-3f5107841243.JPG" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13073690/59371379-785c1200-8d0a-11e9-9fcb-3f5107841243.JPG" alt="outdated" width="690" height="87"></a><br>
Then these queries are moved into “Queries waiting” and never got executed.<br>
<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13073690/59371399-86119780-8d0a-11e9-89ae-bbad82fc6514.JPG" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13073690/59371399-86119780-8d0a-11e9-89ae-bbad82fc6514.JPG" alt="queries-waiting" width="690" height="139"></a></p>
<p>The same query when executed directly are executed ok.<br>
I am using redash version 2.0.1</p>
