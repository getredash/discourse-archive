    <title>Group databases/schemas/tables within a data source</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/group-databases-schemas-tables-within-a-data-source/10188</link>
    <description>We have a data warehouse which has multiple databases, multiple schemas and maaaaany tables for the same data source.
In the data source tab, under queries, it would be nice to have folders for these, like in dbeaver, redshift query editor, etc. So rather than have to scroll through a huuuuuge list of myschema1.table1, myschema1.table2, myschema2.table1, etc etc, we can have just a high level list of folders (the schemas) and then selecting these reveals the list of tables under that schema.
You should be able to open none, one or many schema folders at a time.</description>
