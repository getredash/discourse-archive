    <title>Limit dashboard widgets query</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/limit-dashboard-widgets-query/9765</link>
    <description>If there are multiple widgets in the dashboard, can you limit the number of concurrent queries, or there are many queues in the query engine, resulting in a poor user experience, and from the user level, can you limit the concurrency of each user? The amount of queries, not all queries are added to the query engine at the same time. Thanks!</description>
