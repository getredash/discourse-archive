    <description>### Issue Summary

We host Redash ourselves via AWS. Some of our users can access to the dashboards, but some of them cannot, it seems like there is always a random portion of all our users encountered with ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT with website took too long to respond. Any idea where we can look?

### Technical details:

* Redash Version: 8.0.0+b32245
* Browser/OS: Chrome
* How did you install Redash: AWS hosted</description>

            <p>I agree. The default Redash configuration can handle 100x that many users without problems.</p>
<p>A few other things you can check:</p>
<ul>
<li>what do your docker logs say? do you see failures on the <code>server</code> process?</li>
<li>how many web workers are configured in your <code>docker-compose.yml</code>?</li>
<li>For users who successfully log-in, does everything work normally? Or do they see many errors?</li>
<li>Are you running a proxy in front of Redash somewhere?</li>
</ul>

            <p>Hi Jesse,<br>
Thank you for replying! We have in total 37 users who have access to Redash. I do not think many users are using at the same time, maybe less than 10. Is there a way to improve the situation if the problem is overloading webserver? Thank you!</p>

<p>How many concurrent users do you have? Itâ€™s possible the webserver is overloaded.</p>
