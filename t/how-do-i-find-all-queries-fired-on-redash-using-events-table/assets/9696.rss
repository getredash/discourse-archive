    <title>How do I find all queries fired on Redash using events table?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/how-do-i-find-all-queries-fired-on-redash-using-events-table/9696</link>
    <description>Current setup at our org is something like this - Redash is connected to BQ (bigquery), which is used to fire our queries.

I am trying to map the queries on Redash to the respective users who fired them. I cannot do this via BQ directly, as our Redash&lt;&gt;BQ connection is via a service account (and hence we get no info on the BQ side as to who fired the queries).

So, I am using and joining the Redash tables to get the desired output:

1. Getting all the events from the **events** table with `action` = `&#39;execute&#39;` ,
2. Joining with **queries** table to get the respective queries (using `query_id` in the `additional_comments` column)
3. Joining with **users** table to finally get the user who fired the query.

However, through this process, I end up with lower counts of queries. For example, I can see about 18k queries per day coming from Redash on BQ. However, in the events table I am able to see only ~9k queries on the same day. 

My question is - where are the rest of the queries coming from? Did I miss out on some data/info through this process?</description>
