    <title>Missing pivot barchart</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/missing-pivot-barchart/11062</link>
    <description>Hi all,
I notice there&#39;re some new update on redash in recent days, the new UI/UX looks better. But I also notice that it seems pivot barchart feature was removed, i wonder why this feature is removed? I used this feature a lot and very helpful in my cases. Is that any possibility I can still use the feature or can we have this feature back (if it&#39;s removed) in the near future?

Thank you!</description>

I used this feature a lot and very helpful in my cases. Is that any possibility I can still use the feature or can we have this feature back (if it’s removed) in the near future?</p>
