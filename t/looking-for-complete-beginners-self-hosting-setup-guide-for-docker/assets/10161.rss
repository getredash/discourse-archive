    <title>Looking for complete beginner&#39;s self-hosting setup guide for docker</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/looking-for-complete-beginners-self-hosting-setup-guide-for-docker/10161</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

For the last few years I have developed Power BI reports for customer data visualization, but now we have decided to move on to anoter platform. Redash seems like a very obvious candidate, but the learning curve is a tad steep. 

For a first prototype dashboard I am attempting to self-host redash locally based on the redash/redash docker image, but I can&#39;t seem to find any detailed setup guide.

Are there any step-by-step guides or tutorials out there that does not assume that the user has a lot of background knowledge on the topic?

Cheers, Mike</description>

            <p>Thanks Mike. Glad you have it up and running!</p>

<p>This essentially is what the dev setup is. I wonder what issues you had with images, since the dev setup doesn’t use any…If you feel like it I’m interested to see what errors you encountered.</p>
<p>Would love to see more of this information introduced into the community docs. Thanks for putting these links together!</p>

            <p>Hi jesse,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying. I got Redash up and running in the meantime, but it was a bit of a hassle. Turns out there are a few reasonably good beginner’s introductions, they are just hard to find (see bottom of this post for links).</p>
<p>Rather than using the prebuilt image on docker hub, I pulled the source from github, added .env and docker-compose.yml files, and ran it with “docker-compose up”.</p>
<p>I did give the dev setup a try, but it ended horribly in a ton of errors due to image / library version incompatibilities. Might give it a second try later.</p>
<p>Here are the ressources that helped me get Redash up and running first-time:</p>

            <p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>You can certainly self-host Redash in a docker container. This is in fact the recommended configuration. The link you shared is from a user wishing to deploy on Windows, which is a different animal. Nobody on the core team uses Windows, and I’m not sure I’ve seen any successful reports of it. But in theory it should still be possible.</p>
<p>For a simple deployment and for testing, I’d skip using the docker images and just run the docker developer setup which is very straightforward (but not intended to be productionised): <a href="https://redash.io/help/open-source/dev-guide/docker">https://redash.io/help/open-source/dev-guide/docker</a></p>
<p>The Redash docs have a lot of gaps, but the developer setup is solid. If you run into issues post them here, and hopefully we can incorporate any new learnings into a subsequent revision of the documentation.</p>

            <p>Can anyone at least confirm that they have managed to self-host Redash in a Docker container? This three year old inconclusive <a href="http://discuss.redash.io/t/re-dash-installation-on-windows-10/3325">forum thread</a> implies that it may not even be possible.</p>
