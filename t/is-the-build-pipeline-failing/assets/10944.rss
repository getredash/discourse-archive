    <title>Is the build pipeline failing?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/is-the-build-pipeline-failing/10944</link>
    <description>I believe if you take a look at recent pull requests the build is broken. 

I&#39;ve tried building in CircleCI from my own fork and I get the same error. I was able to get the backend-unit-tests  job to run in circle by setting DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 but thought it was best to report this as to be honest I&#39;m just learning docker etc so the ramifications of this setting might be significant.</description>
