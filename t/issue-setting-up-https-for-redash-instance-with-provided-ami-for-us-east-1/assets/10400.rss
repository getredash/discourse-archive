    <description>### Issue Summary

I am trying to set up HTTPS for our redash instance using the provide AWS ami for us-east-1. I followed the instructions here: https://gist.github.com/arikfr/64c9ff8d2f2b703d4e44fe9e45a7730e and when I try to use the command `docker-compose up -d` I get:
 `Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;bin/docker-compose&quot;, line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
  File &quot;compose/cli/main.py&quot;, line 71, in main

json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
[5834] Failed to execute script docker-compose`

I have tried troubleshooting this on my own but I am getting nowhere and was not sure if anyone had ideas on a workaround

### Technical details:

            <p>Thanks for sharing your solution. That is a <em>very strange</em> stack trace. It doesn’t look related to Redash, actually, but rather to how <code>docker-compose</code> was behaving…</p>

            <p>Instead of using Redash’s server for HTTPS, we just set this up with AWS Certificate Manger and CloudFront</p>
