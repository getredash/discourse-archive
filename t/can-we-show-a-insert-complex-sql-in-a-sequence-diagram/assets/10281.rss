    <title>Can we show a insert complex SQL in a sequence diagram?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/can-we-show-a-insert-complex-sql-in-a-sequence-diagram/10281</link>
    <description>From the main source the SQL is inserting the data to final table, in between it creates many other tables from which data finally flows to the main table. I have created a sequence dropping the .SQL name in box followed with this created table sections. But me question is for every sequence we have a return dotted line. So in this scenario what can we return when it is trying to get the source data to local db table?</description>

            <p>Hi there and welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not quite sure: are you running INSERTs with Redash?</p>
<p>Redash is built only for running SELECT statements. It has no tooling whatsoever to display non-tabular results from the database (with the exception of error messages).</p>
