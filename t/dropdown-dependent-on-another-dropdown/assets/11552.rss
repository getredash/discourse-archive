    <title>Dropdown dependent on another dropdown</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/dropdown-dependent-on-another-dropdown/11552</link>
    <description>Hi!

I would like to have a dropdown, which only displays results depending on the selection within another dropdown. 

The case is that we have several production sites, and several production cycles on each site. I have one column and one dropdown, for both the site and the cycle ID. There are hundreds of production cycles, selecting the one needed is not very convenient. 
I would like to select the site(s) in the first dropdown, and only have the relevant cycle ID-s listed in the second. 
We tried chained select statements but no luck. Do you have an idea? Is it even possible?</description>
