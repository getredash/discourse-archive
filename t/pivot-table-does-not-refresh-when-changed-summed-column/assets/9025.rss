    <title>Pivot table does not refresh when changed summed column</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/pivot-table-does-not-refresh-when-changed-summed-column/9025</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary

I&#39;ve been using the Redash pivot table for years without any problems. Recently I&#39;ve noticed that table does not refresh when I change the column that is used to display data. As you can see in attached image I use a pivot table to group data by &quot;volume&quot; column and as a result, I would like to see Sum of &quot;count&quot; column. This works fine. But then when I change &quot;count&quot; to something else pivot table does not refresh. I have to either change &quot;Sum&quot; operation to something else like &quot;Integral sum&quot; or click left-right arrows which changes order of columns to force refresh on that table.

I&#39;ve also checked at demo.redash.io and could not replicate that behaviour  so maybe it was introduced in newer version (demo.redash.io is using 7.0.0, I&#39;m using redash 8.0.2)

### Technical details:

* Redash Version: 8.0.2
* Browser: Opera 73.0.3856.284, Chrome 90.0.4430.212, Firefox 91.0.2
* Ubuntu 20</description>

<p>I’ve been using the Redash pivot table for years without any problems. Recently I’ve noticed that table does not refresh when I change the column that is used to display data. As you can see in attached image I use a pivot table to group data by “volume” column and as a result, I would like to see Sum of “count” column. This works fine. But then when I change “count” to something else pivot table does not refresh. I have to either change “Sum” operation to something else like “Integral sum” or click left-right arrows which changes order of columns to force refresh on that table.</p>
