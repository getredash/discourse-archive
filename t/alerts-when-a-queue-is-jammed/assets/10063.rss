    <title>Alerts when a queue is jammed</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/alerts-when-a-queue-is-jammed/10063</link>
    <description>Hi,

I would like to know how to alert slack etc. when a query is stuck in the queue.
I am using redash 8.0.0+b32245 (a16f551e).
Currently, my company has 2 queue workers in adhoc and schedule respectively, but the queue gets jammed periodically.
The reason for this is that each query is heavy, but it is painstaking to monitor all the queries. So I would like to be alerted when the queue is clogged, any suggestions?

I would like to thank you for your cooperation.</description>
