    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/how-to-install-redash-io-on-digital-ocean-connecting-database-externally/11705</link>
    <description>My Mysql database is hosted on siteground and i want to connect it to redash.io, which is installed on digital ocean. how will i be able to connect database to redash. i talked to digital ocean support and their response is

&quot; *To connect to the database instance on redash, you would need to add the data source by selecting the database connector based on the database to which you are trying connect to, if you are using Mysql, please select the Mysql connector and input the database details to connect to the data source.*&quot;

My question is does the connector connect to MySql database on siteground or does it create its clone on digital ocean.</description>
