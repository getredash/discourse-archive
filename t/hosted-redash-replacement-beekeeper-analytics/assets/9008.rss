    <title>Hosted Redash Replacement - Beekeeper Analytics</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/hosted-redash-replacement-beekeeper-analytics/9008</link>
    <description>ðŸ‘‹ Hey Redash community.

I&#39;m one of the maintainers of [Beekeeper Studio](https://beekeeperstudio.io), an open source SQL desktop app.

We love Redash and we&#39;re sad to see the hosted version shut down, so we&#39;re thinking of launching our own version of Hosted Redash and wanted to gauge interest.



If you are interested, please fill out the form [on the Beekeeper Analytics Website](https://dash.beekeeperstudio.io).

We&#39;re going to provide a **one-click migration** path and we&#39;re focusing on:

* **Full Compatibility** - All Redash features are replicated, nothing is missing.
* **Price Honoring** - Honoring the price you were paying for Hosted Redash.
* **Simple Migration** - A simple guided migration for all Redash data - queries, dashboards, users, and connections. Our migration will maintain query &amp; dashboard ownership and permissions.
* **Encryption** - All data will be encrypted at-rest and encrypted in transit with HTTPS. We will match or exceed existing Redash security practices.
* **Security** - We&#39;re committed to maintaining a secure environment by running regular external penetration tests.
* **Investment** - We have dedicated bandwidth to continue investment in Redash features, and the open source Redash community.

Hope to hear from some of you soon.
