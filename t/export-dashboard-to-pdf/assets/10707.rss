    <title>Export Dashboard to pdf</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/export-dashboard-to-pdf/10707</link>
    <description>Hello  Dear Community, 

I saw the old post  about the fact that if there will be possibilities to generate a dashboard in pdf, but I did not find any solutions apart from the selinum option which is quite complicated.

I would like to know if there will be any news and suggestions on this subject.

Thank you.</description>
