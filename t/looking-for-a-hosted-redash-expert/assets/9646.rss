            <p>Great! You can check the logs with <code>docker-compose logs -f --tail 100</code>. Then try executing a few queries and see if any exceptions become apparent.</p>
<p>Also, how many users do you have at once? Does your organisation use many scheduled queries? Which services are defined in your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file?</p>

            <p>The answer is always to check the logs first to see what’s happening. Did you install with Docker?</p>

            <p>Was using all available memory but we increased it but that didnt seem to solve the issue. Our Redash instance will go unavailable for small periods at times and queries would take 30+ minutes to run</p>
