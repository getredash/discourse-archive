    <title>Access to QRDS and the MySQL table in one query</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/access-to-qrds-and-the-mysql-table-in-one-query/11288</link>
    <description>I have setup QRDS, I can use it.
For example, I have made a query that returns to me a list of specific collections.
I can access to the results by a query 
```SELECT * FROM query_63``` 
And it works well. 

After that, I have to query from another big table in DB, but only from the records where CollectionID is in the List.
I made a simple query:
     SELECT *  
     FROM BigTableDB   
     WHERE CollectionID IN (SELECT * from query_63)`

But it can not receive the result, because if I choose the source the  MySQL - it can not see the QRDS source. How can I point to the QRDS source from the query?

`Error running query: **Table &#39;videodb.query_63&#39; doesn&#39;t exist**`</description>
