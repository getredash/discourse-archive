    <title>Query Runner for NewRelic Events and Metrics</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/query-runner-for-newrelic-events-and-metrics/10016</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I really like `redash` and have been playing around for couple of days. Few things which I think I am missing are data sources mainly `NewRelic` and `OpsGenie`.

I am thinking to start working the query runner for NewRelic using GraphQL with very basic feature set.

I was going through the documentation `http://discuss.redash.io/t/creating-a-new-query-runner-data-source-in-redash/347` which is over 5 years old. I would like to know if there is any updated document on how to create query runner will definitely help a lot.

If any of those query runner are in line for development, may be I can start working on those in parallel and get them prioritized.

Regards,
Mudasir Mirza.</description>
