    <title>Install and Run Redash on Apple M1 Pro Chip</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/install-and-run-redash-on-apple-m1-pro-chip/10621</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary

Hi Redash community,

I was trying to install and run Redash using docker on my macbook with M1 Pro chip. I have ran into a number of errors when I followed the [Docker Based Developer Installation Guide](https://redash.io/help/open-source/dev-guide/docker). 

The first few errors happened during docker-compose when installing python packages. I managed to bypass those errors by adding pre steps in dockerfile and commenting a few packages in requirements_all_ds.txt file. They are:
* add one step before install python packages in dockerfile:
```RUN pip install Cython;```
this is because pymssql will need Cython as a dependency, and it somehow has to be installed first.
* comment ```pymapd``` and ```ibm-db``` as pyarrow and another dependency won&#39;t work with M1 Chip

After fixing those errors, the containers were up and running, and ```localhost:5000/ping``` returns ```pong```. 

However I was later stuck at installing dependency for the front-end. I followed the instruction ``` yarn --frozen-lockfile```. It returned errors of 
```error An unexpected error occurred: &quot;https://registry.yarnpkg.com/domhandler/-/domhandler-2.4.2.tgz: read ECONNRESET&quot;.``` 
and finally stopped at the stage of fetching packages. I managed to find another post in this forum talking about [M1 chip issue](http://discuss.redash.io/t/error-unable-to-run-docker-compose-on-apple-m1-silicon/7990) and replaced the command with ```npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build```. Unfortunately, it returned the same error - ```error code EINTEGRITY```. 

As I don&#39;t have much experience with frontend development and really desperate to find a solution to those errors, I just wonder if someone here has met the same problems and can shed a bit of light on this?

By the way, I tried another mac with Intel chip and under the same network, it works well with all those steps in the installation guide. So it can&#39;t be the network issue.

The below are full logs for ```yarn --frozen--lockfile``` command

## Description


`docke<span class="show-more-container"><a href="https://github.com/getredash/redash/pull/5788" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="show-more">‚Ä¶</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden">r-compose build` fails while installing `requirements_all_ds.txt` on Apple Silicon because some data source dependencies are pinned to versions incompatible with the ARM architecture. This blocks users from running / developing Redash on our fancy new Macs unless we selectively remove the incompatible lines of `requirements_all_ds.txt` (`pymapd` for example).

Long-term we should ensure that all dependencies are compatible across platforms. This PR implements an effective, hands-free solution until then.

#### Benefits

This change allows the build to continue even if a data source dependency cannot be installed. It works by using `xargs` to feed `requirements_all_ds.txt` to `pip install` line-by-line. The final command `|| true` suppresses the exit code from `xargs` (which will be code `123` if any of the calls to `pip install` returns a non-zero code) so that Docker will continue building.

Since query_runners wrap their imports in `try...` blocks, any query runner that depends on a package that wasn't installed will fail gracefully without crashing the app.

#### Risks

Calling `pip install` line-by-line slows down `docker-compose build`.

Because we catch all non-zero exit codes, a user will need to run `docker-compose build --progress=plain` to see whether or not all dependencies were installed.

<p>Thanks for your reply. yes, it supports Rosetta. I haven‚Äôt touched that bit for now. Will explore it and post if I have any updates.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://discuss.redash.io/u/jesse">@jesse</a> ,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply. I checked that page before I made new post. It was one error I met before. I solved it by pointing node version to 14 in homebrew and after that, node and yarn commands can be triggered.<br>
My error is when installing dependencies for the frontend, some packages look like not compatible with M1 chip. I‚Äôm not a front end developer, so it‚Äôs just my gut feeling. The error message was <code>error An unexpected error occurred: "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/domhandler/-/domhandler-2.4.2.tgz: read ECONNRESET".</code>. Would you mind shedding some lights on?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Steve</p>

            <h3>
<a name="issue-summary-1" class="anchor" href="https://discuss.redash.io#issue-summary-1"></a>Issue Summary</h3>
<p>Hi Redash community,</p>
<p>I was trying to install and run Redash using docker on my macbook with M1 Pro chip. I have ran into a number of errors when I followed the <a href="https://redash.io/help/open-source/dev-guide/docker" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Docker Based Developer Installation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The first few errors happened during docker-compose when installing python packages. I managed to bypass those errors by adding pre steps in dockerfile and commenting a few packages in requirements_all_ds.txt file. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>add one step before install python packages in dockerfile:<br>
<code>RUN pip install Cython;</code><br>
this is because pymssql will need Cython as a dependency, and it somehow has to be installed first.</li>
<li>comment <code>pymapd</code> and <code>ibm-db</code> as pyarrow and another dependency won‚Äôt work with M1 Chip</li>
</ul>
<p>After fixing those errors, the containers were up and running, and <code>localhost:5000/ping</code> returns <code>pong</code>.</p>
<p>However I was later stuck at installing dependency for the front-end. I followed the instruction <code> yarn --frozen-lockfile</code>. It returned errors of<br>
<code>error An unexpected error occurred: "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/domhandler/-/domhandler-2.4.2.tgz: read ECONNRESET".</code><br>
and finally stopped at the stage of fetching packages. I managed to find another post in this forum talking about <a href="http://discuss.redash.io/t/error-unable-to-run-docker-compose-on-apple-m1-silicon/7990">M1 chip issue</a> and replaced the command with <code>npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build</code>. Unfortunately, it returned the same error - <code>error code EINTEGRITY</code>.</p>
<p>As I don‚Äôt have much experience with frontend development and really desperate to find a solution to those errors, I just wonder if someone here has met the same problems and can shed a bit of light on this?</p>
<p>By the way, I tried another mac with Intel chip and under the same network, it works well with all those steps in the installation guide. So it can‚Äôt be the network issue.</p>
<p>The below are full logs for <code>yarn --frozen--lockfile</code> command</p>
