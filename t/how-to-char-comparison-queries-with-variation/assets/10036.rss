    <title>How to char comparison queries with % variation</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/how-to-char-comparison-queries-with-variation/10036</link>
    <description>Hi,

I am currently working on a `query runner` for `NewRelic` and have successfully implemented `count` and `comparison` queries. 

I am facing an issue in visualization. I am not sure how to chart the `comparison` query, the query returns two records `usually previous and current with count`.

What will be the best method to chart this data. Also is there any visualization that can show `percentage % variation` in the two records.
Something like `x% up or down based on current and previous records`.

This can help different type of data also.

Regards,
Mudasir Mirza.</description>
