    <title>Embedded dashboard with dashboard Level filtering in URL</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/embedded-dashboard-with-dashboard-level-filtering-in-url/9160</link>
    <description>I have a dashboard that uses a dashboard level filter called Account. I created an external share link yet I can&#39;t see that dashboard level filter when I access the dashboard through the external link.

Also, I am trying to manipulate the filter (the dashboard level one which I can&#39;t see) or the other 6 filters on the dashboard through the URL and am not getting anywhere.
 I tried adding ?p_accounts=MYACCOUNT but it seems to not do anything both on the original URL and on the share URL.

The external share URL looks like this /public/dashboards/xxxxxxxxxxx?org_slug=default.

Any help is much appreciated.</description>
