### Issue Summary

I am easily able to &quot;crash&quot; Redash by opening 10-15 Query tabs in a single browser.  I can reproduce with 100% consistency.

### Technical details:

* Redash Version:  8.0.2+b37747 (a9d7ca43)
* Browser/OS: firefox 95
* How did you install Redash:

We run Redash as a collection of contiainers, running as ECS Services in Amazon.
* scheduler, scheduled_worker and adhoc_worker are each independent ECS Services
* We use AWS ElasticCache instead of redis
* We use an RDS database for the backend
* &quot;server&quot; and &quot;nginx&quot; containers run together in a single ECS Task, which runs via an ECS Service.

To reproduce:
From the /queries endpoint I command-click each query in the list (all 20 on the first page), to open each Query Detail page in its own tab.  When I do this, the first few will load quickly, but the remainder will just sit and spin for a minute or so, and then all return 5XX errors.

Behind the scenes, I see that the AWS Load Balancer is taking the Task out of service due to health check timeout.  Example event from ECS Service Events ...

`service (REDACTED) (instance REDACTED) (port 49159) is unhealthy in target-group (REDACTED) due to (reason Request timed out)`

It seems that after maybe 10 or so requests, redash is unable to serve requests fast enough and the task gets taken out of service.  The health check is configured with a 30 second timeout.

![Screen Shot 2021-12-21 at 1.23.59 PM|690x91](upload://ahywjtrCEB5O9oSQltDOCdpBpbY.png)

So it *looks like* our issue here is that redash can&#39;t serve requests quickly if it gets many all at once.  I&#39;ve not tried any other exhaustive testing here.  For example, I haven&#39;t tried loading the *same page* 10 times or tried loading from 10 different workstations at once.

This is the extent of the investigation I&#39;ve done.  I haven&#39;t looked at logs to figure out why/where things are choking.  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you

            <p>oops, sorry about that. sloppy/paste. fixed.  version is 8.0.2+b37747 (a9d7ca43)</p>
<p>yeah, something is probably wrong with the configuration, we’re just not sure what it is.  Do you think the worker is the likely bottleneck ?</p>

            <p>You didn’t specify which version of Redash you’re using.</p>
<p>I assume something is broken with your configuration, as this isn’t a Redash problem. I tested locally with a single worker in our local development setup.  I can open 50 concurrent tabs and execute a sizeable query in 10+ tabs without crashing anything. Just the standard delay where some queries must wait until a worker is available.</p>
<p>Testing with our V8 AMI upgraded to V10.1 it won’t crash under these circumstances either.</p>

    That’s not normal. Please open a separate thread so we can debug it. We’ll need to know exactly what you mean by crashing, and what your docker logs show.
