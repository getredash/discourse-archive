    <title>Counter scorecard based on date</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/counter-scorecard-based-on-date/8815</link>
    <description>Hi,

I have mysql db connected and queried. The database is filled with entries several times a week but not daily. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to show daily entries in counter if they have been submitted that day? Meaning that if there was a submission, counter will show the counted totals from the appropriate column and if there haven&#39;t been any, counter will show 0.  In other words I want counter to update daily and show records if there are any in that day and 0, if there are none.

Thanks!</description>
