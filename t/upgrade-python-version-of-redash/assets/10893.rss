    <title>Upgrade python version of Redash</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/upgrade-python-version-of-redash/10893</link>
    <description>Hey!

I was wondering if there&#39;s &quot;best practice&quot; to update Redash&#39;s python version.

Use case:
I&#39;ve added python as a Redash datasource (and everything works fine),
However, I need to work with Scipy version 1.9, which is supported just from python 3.8. However, Redash&#39;s python version is set to 3.7.

I can custom build Redash with base python 3.8, which seems like the easiest solution.
However, in general, I would rather to stick with the official docker images.

Is there such image that I&#39;ve missed?
Alternative, any other idea other then building it on my own?</description>

            <p>Yes, I recall, I’ve been updating versions of some libraries as well. In case of pymysql, it was updated to 2.1.5.<br>
You can check locally for versions compatibility, just run all requirements.txt files in a virtual environment and “play” with them a little bit.<br>
It is what I did and found a golden mean</p>

            <p>I have no idea how that worked for you.<br>
As for example, one of the required modules is <code>pymssql</code> which calls <code>platform.linux_distribution()</code> as part of its setup.</p>
<p><code>package.linux_distribution</code> was deprecated starting with Python 3.5(?). and removed altogether for Python 3.8.</p>
<p>I’ll just rebuild it my self an issue a PR for the fixed docker file.</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
