    <title>Failed after upgrading docker image</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/failed-after-upgrading-docker-image/2189</link>
    <description>Hi Redash Team! Hope you&#39;re all well.

Info: 
Docker version: 1.13.1
Currently deployed: 
Redash 3.0.0+b3134
redis:3.0-alpine
postgres:9.5.6-alpine

Scenario:
I have redash running in docker and wanted to upgrade it with the latest version.
What I did is migrate my postgres data to new server and use docker-compose.yml and run docker-compose up
Unfortunately I&#39;m stuck with this error in postgres;
ERROR:  column queries.search_vector does not exist at character 792
and in worker;
ProgrammingError: (psycopg2.ProgrammingError) column queries.search_vector does not exist

Tried searching complete guide to upgrade Redash docker image but found only a very basic setup which doesn&#39;t work for me.

Please guide me how to do it properly; its been 1 week of searching guides to fix it but failed to find a thing.

Hoping for your soonest response.</description>

            <p>Do you have something like this guide for Docker? <a href="https://redash.io/help/open-source/admin-guide/how-to-upgrade" rel="nofollow noopener">https://redash.io/help/open-source/admin-guide/how-to-upgrade</a>.<br>
Simply pulling the latest redash image and using existing postgres DB doesn’t work. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/disappointed.png?v=6" title=":disappointed:" class="emoji" alt=":disappointed:"><br>
Even running “docker-compose run --rm server manage db upgrade” before and or after pulling latest docker image has no difference, still fails.</p>
<p>Also have tried this process but still no avail;</p>
<ol>
<li>Update the image reference to redash/redash:4.0.0.b3948.</li>
<li>Stop services.</li>
<li>Apply migrations (docker-compose run --rm server manage db upgrade).</li>
<li>Start everything with docker-compose up.</li>
</ol>

Already did that but still got the same result. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/cry.png?v=6" title=":cry:" class="emoji" alt=":cry:"></p>
<p>ERROR:  column queries.search_vector does not exist at character 792</p>
<p>Additional info about my existing redash, I just used the docker-compose.production.yml default to bring up the cluster, i just added google and cookie key that’s the only changes i made.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You need to apply migrations. You can do with something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">docker-compose run --rm server manage db upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>You might need to change the name of the service (server), depends on your configuration.</p>
