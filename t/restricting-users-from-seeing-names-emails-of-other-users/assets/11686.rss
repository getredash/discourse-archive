    <title>Restricting users from seeing names/emails of other users</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/restricting-users-from-seeing-names-emails-of-other-users/11686</link>
    <description>Hi,
I added a new user to a group ( without admin or default permission ) and associated data source. Everything works fine except the user is able to see names and emails of everyone who has access to redash instance. Even though the others users are not part of same group. In many ways, this kills the purpose of group level visibility. Is there a way to manage this ?</description>
