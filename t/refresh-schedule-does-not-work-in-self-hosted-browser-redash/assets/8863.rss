    <title>[Refresh Schedule] Does not work in self-hosted (browser) Redash</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/refresh-schedule-does-not-work-in-self-hosted-browser-redash/8863</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary

None of my Redash Queries are running at the schedule I set (every 30 minutes, every 1 day at exactly 07:30am UTC, etc). 

I need this to run at these regular intervals so my corresponding Alert can trigger at the scheduled times.

![2021-08-03 Auto Refresh Schedule|404x258](upload://9GYc66OPQXDeD3zaOgXHH19ZuRe.png)

I&#39;ve seen this question come up in multiple past discussions, but have not found a solution that works. Will my organisation need to upgrade to v9 in order to get this working? We&#39;re not using Docker or anything like that, purely the self-hosted, in-browser Redash. 

Thanks!

### Technical details:

* Redash Version: v8
* Browser/OS: Chrome and Firefox
* How did you install Redash: https://data.ourorganisationname.xyz/</description>

            <p>Your IT team will know how to do this. It’s the same step needed to start the scheduler intially. Basically just run the <code>celery worker</code> command and pass it the context information (number of workers, which app to run, number threads etc.)</p>

            <p>The problem is your scheduler keeps crashing. You will need to restart it periodically. Upgrading to V9 or V10 (which will be formally released in a couple weeks) fixes this since we replaced the problematic Celery with RQ for our task queue.</p>
<p>Just for clarity:</p>

<p>This problem has nothing to do with how you installed Redash. The Docker version is just easier to maintain. No part of the server runs in your browser.</p>
