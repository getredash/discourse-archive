    <title>Share dashboard with peers with View only permission without query/DB access</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/share-dashboard-with-peers-with-view-only-permission-without-query-db-access/8921</link>
    <description>I intend to share a dashboard with a few peers, but don&#39;t want them to have access to the Dashboard queries/Database/tables/schemas etc.

I am connected to Redshift, but don&#39;t see any such permission. Also came across an old post [here](http://discuss.redash.io/t/view-permission-dashboard-first/579), but not sure if there&#39;s any such provision in Redash. Currently I&#39;m using Redash 8.0.

Let me know around the same if possible.</description>

            <p>The only way to do this is with secret share links. The feature you linked has not been implemented but it’s high on our list.</p>
