    <title>Are dynamic drop down filters in Redash supported in the latest redash?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/are-dynamic-drop-down-filters-in-redash-supported-in-the-latest-redash/10564</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary

A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs.

### Technical details:
If a query has 2 dropdown filters on a dashboard, changing the values in the first dropdown does not change the values in the second dropdown. ideally, dropdowns should be in sync when querying data, which can be very helpful for the end-users who are not very technical in nature and can reduce confusion. Is this something that is already supported or is planned for a future release?

* Redash Version: 11.0.0
* Browser/OS: macOS
* How did you install Redash: It is a docker based install on Kubernetes orchestrated cluster</description>

            <p>This feature has been long requested but nobody in the community has implemented it yet. For now, each dropdown parameter operates independently.</p>
