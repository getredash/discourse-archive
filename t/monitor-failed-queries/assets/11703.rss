    <title>Monitor failed queries</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/monitor-failed-queries/11703</link>
    <description>Is there a way to monitor failed queries?
Basically, when I change a data source and mess up I want to be able check that the current queries still work.
It would be great if I could execute all queries or a set of queries globally. Going through each query manually would be quite bothersome :smiley: 
Also, ongoing monitor with a view where I can see a graph of failed queries and a possibility to drill down to see the actual query or anything along those lines would be super.

Cheers,
Johannes M.</description>
