    <title>Redash Scalability</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/redash-scalability/9903</link>
    <description>We are trying to  scale redash horizontally .
it would be great if some one let us know related to how exactly its possible including both pros and cons.
Basically idea is to configure redash in 2 different server  .Each server would be running redash worker in docker container in 2 different server  and pointing to same metadata postgres server. 
Please let us know how to achieve it.</description>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://discuss.redash.io/u/deepakdas12">@deepakdas12</a> ,</p>
<p>I am also a beginner when it comes to <code>redash</code>, but I would say if you keep the <code>REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET</code> and <code>REDASH_SECRET_KEY</code> same in both instances, and point to the same <code>postgres</code> instance, it should work fine.<br>
You would need to setup a <code>load balancer</code> in front of the instances and my suggestion would be to enable <code>sticky session</code> in the <code>load balancer</code>.</p>
<p>May be someone else can provide better answer.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Mudasir Mirza.</p>
