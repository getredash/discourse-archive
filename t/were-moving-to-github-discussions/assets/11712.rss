    <title>‼️ We&#39;re moving to GitHub discussions ‼️</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/were-moving-to-github-discussions/11712</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

We have decided to move our community discussions from the Discourse forum to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/getredash/redash/discussions). This is part of our effort to simplify and bring everything into one place.

We hope that this change will make it easier for everyone to participate in the community discussions and share their ideas.

As a result of this change, the Discourse forum will move into read-only mode. If anyone wants to help with creating an archive from it or importing here, please reach out.

Thank you for your understanding and we hope you find the new platform useful!</description>
