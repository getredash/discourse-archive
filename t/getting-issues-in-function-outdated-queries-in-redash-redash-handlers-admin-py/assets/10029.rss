    <title>Getting issues in function outdated_queries in redash/redash/handlers/admin.py</title>

    <description>Hi 

I am using Redash 10 (redash:10.1.0.b50633)

After flushing the Redis I am getting errors originated from the file redash/redash/handlers/admin.py with function outdated_queries

The code with issue - manager_status = redis_connection.hgetall(&quot;redash:status&quot;)
it seems the manager_status is having value {}

which needs to be checked before using the manager_status[&quot;last_refresh_at&quot;]

that is why the api &quot;/api/admin/queries/outdated&quot;, methods=[&quot;GET&quot;] is failing after the Redis flush 

due this the page admin/queries/outdated is throwing errors - &quot; It seems like we encountered an error. Try refreshing this page or contact your administrator.&quot;


Can you Pls add this code if hasattr(manager_status, &#39;last_refresh_at&#39;):
in as patch for latest Redash version 10 ?

Thanks for your help</description>
