    <title>Cloudwatch Query with dynamic timestamps</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/cloudwatch-query-with-dynamic-timestamps/9945</link>
    <description>I am getting started on doing some simple Cloudwatch Queries in Redash. Unfortunately I don&#39;t get expressions to work but at the very least I want to have a simple query be limited by a certain timespan. 
I cannot use a variable parameter as I want to use the query for alerts.

For example:
```
StartTime: &quot;2022-02-01 00:00:00&quot;
EndTime: &quot;`sdfsdfdfj`&quot;
MetricDataQueries:
- Id: db001
  MetricStat:
    Metric:
      Namespace: AWS/RDS
      MetricName: FreeableMemory
      Dimensions:
      - Name: DBInstanceIdentifier
        Value: &quot;db001&quot;
    Period: 300
    Stat: Average
```
Works just fine however it does not seem to care about the value in end-time. What I really want is to just return the last value for that database. 

Hope my request makes sense.</description>
