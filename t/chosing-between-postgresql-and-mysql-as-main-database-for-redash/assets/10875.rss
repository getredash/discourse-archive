    <title>Chosing between PostgreSQL and MySQL as main database for Redash</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/chosing-between-postgresql-and-mysql-as-main-database-for-redash/10875</link>
    <description>Hey folks üëã !

I was wondering if you guys have planned to support MySQL as an additional option to be used as main database for Redash ? And therefore have the option to choose between MySQL and PostgreSQL.

I managed to make it work by changing few types (postgresql.array, postgresql.json) in the models to mysql.json, as everything is managed by sqlalchemy it&#39;s not too complicated to make the changes and try out. There is one limitation though, the Full Text Search that I did not managed to support yet on the mysql dev version.

Do you think this is something useful to have ? Do you find any limitations ?

Peace ‚úåÔ∏è</description>

            <p>Thanks for your post and welcome to the forum. We‚Äôve experimented with this, actually. Realistically it won‚Äôt make sense for us to maintain compatibility for <em>both</em> Postgres and MySQL as a backend. But I can see migrating to MySQL / MariaDB in the future.</p>
