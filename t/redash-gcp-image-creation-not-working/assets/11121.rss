    <title>Redash GCP image creation not working</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/redash-gcp-image-creation-not-working/11121</link>
    <description>I tried running the install command given in GCP documentation but the command is taking a long time and timing out. I tried reading the gcs file but I am also getting an 403 error saying I do not have enough permissions.
```
gcloud compute images create &quot;redash-8-0-0&quot; --source-uri gs://redash-images/redash.8.0.0-b32245-1.tar.gz
```
Is the documentation still up to date and is this working for others? Is there some public GCS file that I can read the image from?</description>

            <p>I’m having the same issue, at this point I guess I’m just waiting for the images to get updated for v10</p>
<p>I ran a local terminal, and after some time (at least 30 minutes, I didn’t catch the exact time it returned, I got this message:<br>
