    <description>### Issue Summary

A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs.

Upgraded redash to **10.0.0.b50363** and postgres to **14** , Didn&#39;t faced any issue while upgrading, but on of sudden got an issue saying **Error message: Error running query: failed communicating with server. Please check your Internet connection and try again.**,

Tried to downgrade postgres to 13 , but the container keeps on restating even after adding 
restart : unless-stopped in my compose file.

Does redash 10 , support postgres versions higher then 9 ?

instance type: r5a.xlarge

And what can be the resolution. ?

* Redash Version: 10.0.0.b50363
* Browser/OS: brave / centos
