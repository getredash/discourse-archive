    <title>Is it safe to run multiple instances of the redash webapp concurrently?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/is-it-safe-to-run-multiple-instances-of-the-redash-webapp-concurrently/9726</link>
    <description>We are increasing our usage of Redash and quickly encountering availability concerns.  I&#39;m seeking **official** confirmation from @arikfr / @jesse / et al. on this topic:  is it **safe** to run multiple instances of the Redash webapp concurrently, in order to achieve high availability?

This question has been asked several times, over several years, but with no official response.

http://discuss.redash.io/t/high-availability/1909
http://discuss.redash.io/t/multiple-instance-of-redash-in-ha/5467
(note that as a new user, I&#39;m prohibited from posting more than 2 links - there are others)

I&#39;ll elaborate on our configuration.

We run Redash as a collection of ECS Services in AWS with an RDS database backend.  
The ECS Services are all *mono-services* i.e. we run exactly 1 instance of each:

* redash scheduler
* redash adhoc worker
* redash scheduled worker

We don&#39;t have any concerns or issues with the scheduler or worker services.  They are available enough for our needs, and not user-facing.

Our concern is with the ECS (mono-) Service which runs both the **redash** and **nginx** Containers for us.  We want to understand whether we can safely run multiple instances of these Containers (either separately or together) in order to achieve high availability.  Our concern is that, if Redash is not designed to handle concurrent write activity, we will have data corruption.  Thus we&#39;re seeking official confirmation that Redash is designed to run **safely** in such a multi-instance mode.  

As an AWS-managed service, the database is already highly available.  We&#39;re seeking to make Redash itself also highly available as our usage increases.  Any confirmation and guidance you can offer will be greatly appreciated.</description>

<p>This would not be possible because only the query owner can edit the query. If experimental multi-owner support is enabled and both users own the query then User A’s change would be lost. This is really a front-end concern though. It makes sense to add a check which checks that the query hash from the API has not changed since the page was loaded.</p>

<p>User A pulls up a certain Query in Redash.  A few seconds later User B pulls up the same query.  Each user makes independent, non-conflicting changes.  User A saves changes, then a few seconds later User B saves.</p>
<p>Will the resultant Query contain User A’s changes?  It sounds like they will be overwritten.  DB table locks don’t help here and this situation would result in end-user data loss. i.e. User A’s work has been lost.</p>

            <p>Thank you, <a class="mention" href="https://discuss.redash.io/u/jesse">@jesse</a> !  If you happen to remember, please post that doc here once it’s available.  Our group will review for sure. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/fist/3.png?v=10" title=":fist:t3:" class="emoji" alt=":fist:t3:"></p>
<p>This is great news to have this confirmation.  Currently we’re having issues where a single user can <em>easily</em> crash Redash (just by opening 10-15 queries in different tabs of the browser).  We need to fix that issue first because our Redash just isn’t stable at the moment.  But knowing we can run multiples concurrently could help to reduce some of the user-facing errors that result from an instance being taken offline for any reason.</p>
<p>Thanks again.<br>

            <p><strong>Yes</strong>. It is safe to run multiple webservers and nginx instances. Redash is designed such that this is safe for concurrent write activity as it uses locks on the database tables. Prior to its EOL, hosted Redash had (I think) three webservers and three nginx instances without issue.</p>
<p>Looking forward: we will prepare and release a full document about high-availability Redash including a tutorial for deploying in Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Thanks for making another post about this. If you run into issues with HA deployment please post and discuss about them here. It will help us in forming the official document on the subject.</p>

    Hi guys, I’d like to know if there’s some tips&amp;tricks to have multiple redash instance balanced by nginx in active/passive mode using a centralized postgresql. I mean: Having multiple redash instance running on several servers that using the same postgresql, could be cause some problems? Or a single redash instance don’t do anything on DB unless someone connect directly on it? 
Thansk in advance.

<p>I’ll elaborate on our configuration.</p>
<p>We run Redash as a collection of ECS Services in AWS with an RDS database backend.<br>
The ECS Services are all <em>mono-services</em> i.e. we run exactly 1 instance of each:</p>
<ul>
<li>redash scheduler</li>
<li>redash adhoc worker</li>
<li>redash scheduled worker</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t have any concerns or issues with the scheduler or worker services.  They are available enough for our needs, and not user-facing.</p>
<p>Our concern is with the ECS (mono-) Service which runs both the <strong>redash</strong> and <strong>nginx</strong> Containers for us.  We want to understand whether we can safely run multiple instances of these Containers (either separately or together) in order to achieve high availability.  Our concern is that, if Redash is not designed to handle concurrent write activity, we will have data corruption.  Thus we’re seeking official confirmation that Redash is designed to run <strong>safely</strong> in such a multi-instance mode.</p>
<p>As an AWS-managed service, the database is already highly available.  We’re seeking to make Redash itself also highly available as our usage increases.  Any confirmation and guidance you can offer will be greatly appreciated.</p>
