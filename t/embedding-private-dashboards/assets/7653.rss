    <title>Embedding private dashboards</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/embedding-private-dashboards/7653</link>
    <description>Hello, and thanks for an amazing product!

My use case is as follows:
I&#39;d like to embed dashboards into another application. My gut feeling is that publicly shared dashboards won&#39;t cut it security wise, so I would like to embed dashboards that are not publicly shared. 

Per the docs, this should work: &quot;Embedding a dashboard in this way will require users to be logged-in to Redash.&quot;.

I&#39;m a little confused as to how this should work? Is there a way to programmatically log in to redash and receive like a jwt or api key or something, and then forward this as a url parameter when requesting the dashboard?

Or what strategy could I employ to let specific users access specific dashboards but nothing else?

Thanks in advance!</description>

            <p>Hello, I’m also interested in this. Could anyone please let me know if this case is supported by Redash v10?</p>
