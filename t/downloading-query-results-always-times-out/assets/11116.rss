    <title>Downloading query results always times out</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/downloading-query-results-always-times-out/11116</link>
    <description> when calling results api, I get the following error for a query with a large result body: &quot;curl: (18) transfer closed with 144635144 bytes remaining to read&quot;. in the redash dashboard, I see the network request to download the results shows: &quot;(failed) net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH&quot;. This doesn&#39;t happen to all of my teammates, some of them are able to get the results downloaded every time. But I, and a few other teammates, get this error everytime. my theory is that my teammates who successfully download the results have faster internet than me, and the redash server is aborting the connection before the I&#39;ve successfully downloaded the entire query result body. any help is appreciated :slight_smile:</description>
