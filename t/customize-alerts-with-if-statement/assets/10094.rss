    <title>Customize alerts with IF statement</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/customize-alerts-with-if-statement/10094</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary

We added Atlassian Status Page to our stack and we want to use our redash monitoring as a few components there.
For it to work we need to:
1. add another email recipient as the destination 
2. the email subject should contain either DOWN or UP words.

the issue is with #2, currently, redash sends emails with TRIGGERED or OK keywords. I need to customize the alert to send DOWN/UP.

How do I do that?

Ideally would be if I can write in the alert customization:
if {{ALERT_STATUS}} == TRIGGERED:
  DOWN 
else
  UP

            <p>I don’t think you can do this without some modifications to the source code. It would be nice to have some custom control over what to display instead of OK vs TRIGGERED. We’re happy to review a pull request implementing this as an option on alerts.</p>
