    <title>Jobs not processed on Redash V9 installation using the setup script</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/jobs-not-processed-on-redash-v9-installation-using-the-setup-script/8739</link>
    <description>Hi all, I am facing an issue with the installation of redash V9...

I am using the [setup script](https://github.com/getredash/setup) to complete the installation. 
while this works well with redash v8, when i set the target docker image(in the docker-compose.yml:3) from **redash/redash:8.0.0.b32245**
to **redash/redash:9.0.0-beta.b49509**, the resulting redash instance works well except that the queued jobs are not getting started which means that some functionality is not working properly (mails, alerts, periodic tasks etc))

![image|690x181](upload://rMKQXZzsqlf9IkO9ufFRIgQFyxD.png)


I suspect this is related to the fact celery was replaced by RQ in V9 but i am not sure how to confirm or debug that hypothesis. 
I&#39;ve seen this line in the [docker-compose.yml which mentions &quot;celery&quot;](https://github.com/getredash/setup/blob/master/data/docker-compose.yml#L21) 
![image|483x151](upload://peS15x7aTAQjx1e7jlCXlut3oBG.png)
and i suspect this should probably be changed to something else. tried &quot;RQ&quot; and tried to remove this env var with no different result...

These are the logs of the scheduler(no more logs are appended no matter what i do):

These are the logs of the scheduled worker:

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The setup script has not been updated since V8. You can use it as a guide but it won’t be exact. This is mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/getredash/redash/blob/d8d7c78992e44a4b6d7fdd4c39ccc1c35cd8c7a9/CHANGELOG.md#upgrading">CHANGELOG</a> which addresses this directly.</p>
<p>tl;dr you can delete the <code>QUEUES</code> and <code>WORKERS_COUNT</code> keys. And you need to add a new worker for periodic jobs.</p>
