    <title>Add Favorite Dashboards and Queries to Left Nav in Redash 10</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/add-favorite-dashboards-and-queries-to-left-nav-in-redash-10/8965</link>
    <description>Got some feedback from the team after upgrading from v8 to v10, the biggest change was the loss of the favorites bar at the top, which they loved!

After getting some more feedback, our team would like to either have that back or, if possible, added as part of the new left nav!

Clicking on redash icon at the top does not feel intuitive to the team, but they are getting used to it now, would be cool to have that be more intuitive.</description>
