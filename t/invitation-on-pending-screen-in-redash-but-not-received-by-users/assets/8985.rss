    <title>Invitation on pending screen in Redash but not received by users</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/invitation-on-pending-screen-in-redash-but-not-received-by-users/8985</link>
    <description>Hi Support,

I have been trying to add my colleagues on Redash however, they have not been receiving any invites. I tried this with a few different emails from within the organization but to no avail. This has just begin to happen from the last two days. 
All of them appear on the pending invites page.

Thanks</description>

            <p>Sounds like your email server might be malfunctioning. How did you install Redash?</p>
