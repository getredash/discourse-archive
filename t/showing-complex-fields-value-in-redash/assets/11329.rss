    <title>Showing complex fields value in Redash</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/showing-complex-fields-value-in-redash/11329</link>
    <description>Hi,
I am using Redash with BigQuery.
We use tables with complex fields like Struct.
Redash does not show the complex fields in the tables list so it is very difficult to see the schema. 
In addition, in the results the fields are hardly readable.
Is there a solution for it?

Thanks


We are using a custom Redash installation used with Chrome</description>
