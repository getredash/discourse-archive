    <title>Ability to remove &quot;back to normal&quot; in alerts</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/ability-to-remove-back-to-normal-in-alerts/11064</link>
    <description>Currently I&#39;m using alerts to notify things that happen in the DB that doesn&#39;t have a trigger associated and I can check with pooling. 

For example, 
    - When a company sets a day promotion (those promotions finish at the end of the day)
    - Daily to check any negative rating

In those examples I want to inform when something happens without having to be inform when the query is back to normal.

I saw the code to implement this could be just as simple adding a condition here to ignore 
 back to normal notification https://github.com/getredash/redash/blob/master/redash/destinations/mattermost.py 

I wonder if either I could get a workaround or we could get a feature for this.</description>

            <p>We decided a hardcoded solution we just modified the behavior of the python files manually,  not great but at least it works.</p>
