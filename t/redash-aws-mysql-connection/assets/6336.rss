    <title>Redash AWS MySQL Connection</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/redash-aws-mysql-connection/6336</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary

Hey all, i&#39;m running Redash on AWS with redash-8.0.0-b32245-1-eu-central-1 and since some days I&#39;m getting the following error for all my MySql Querries.
    (2013, &quot;Lost connection to MySQL server at &#39;reading authorization packet&#39;, system error: 11&quot;)

Even after creating the data sources again or restarting the ec2 instance, I&#39;m having the same issues. It was working perfectly fine for some weeks, at some point it just stopped working.
I can still access the Databases (also running in AWS) directly, they are working (as far as I can see).

### Technical details:

* Redash Version: 8.0.0
* Browser/OS: Windows 10 / Chrome
* How did you install Redash: AWS redash-8.0.0-b32245-1-eu-central-1</description>

            <p>Hey, thanks for your reply. Yes I’m sure it has. The issue was related to AWS changing the use of SSL. After a restart of the redash instance and disableing SSL in the datasource everything started working again.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the forum! This sounds like a firewall issue to me. Are you certain your Redash VM has access to SQL server?</p>
