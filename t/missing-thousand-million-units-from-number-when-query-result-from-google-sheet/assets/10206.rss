    <title>Missing thousand / million units from number when Query Result from Google Sheet</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/missing-thousand-million-units-from-number-when-query-result-from-google-sheet/10206</link>
    <description>I imported a data source from Google Sheet. Everything worked fine! 

But when I tried to query result from google sheet, the number behaved weirdly. 
I want to divide a column with a specific number however:

1,000,000 suddenly became 1.
108,000 suddenly became 108 
in my calculation. 

Could any one help please. Thanks</description>
