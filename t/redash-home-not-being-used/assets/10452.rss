    <title>REDASH_HOME not being used?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/redash-home-not-being-used/10452</link>
    <description>Dear Folks,

(I can&#39;t put links in my post :) because I&#39;m a new user. thus please substitute &lt;example_org&gt; https://example.org from here on and &lt;localhost_5000&gt; with http://localhost:5000

I&#39;m trying to deploy redash on my &lt;example_org&gt; server under the &lt;example_org&gt;/redash path. The server already has an nginx listening on port 80 so the redash docker-compose starts all the containers successfully, except the nginx one. But this is not a problem since the system seems to be working:

the following work
    curl &lt;localhost_5000&gt; 
    curl &lt;localhost_5000&gt;/login
    curl &lt;localhost_5000&gt;/static/server.5cdfe7b4f652b665b03f.css

are all successful locally on the server.

the following works from the outside

    curl &lt;example_org&gt;/redash/static/server.5cdfe7b4f652b665b03f.css

i get to see the css. 

however, when I try to 

    curl &lt;example_org&gt;/redash

it fails because the page redirects to the &lt;example_org&gt;/login  instead of &lt;example_org&gt;/redash/login

I thought that this was the point of REDASH_HOME variable to allow the redash to generate prefixed urls. So I set it in the /opt/redash/env file, but as far as I can see, this does not work. The generated urls are still not prefixed with it.

Am I doing something wrong? 
Is this question even clear? :slight_smile: 
Can somebody provide an advice?

Thanks!

            <p>For future readers: Redash is not intended to mount at a subdirectory. It’s meant to run at the root location for the server. I believe there are some workarounds to make it work (and we’d be happy to merge a pull request making this an option). But for the moment it’s not supported as of V10.</p>

            <p>ah, forget about this folks. I’ve deployed under <a href="http://redash.example.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">redash.example.com</a> and this solved the problem <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
