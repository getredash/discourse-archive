    <title>Redash migration guide</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/redash-migration-guide/9721</link>
    <description>We wrote a guide of how to migrate from redash.io to a hossted based redash instance.
[https://hossted.com/blog/redash-migration/](https://hossted.com/blog/redash-migration/)
As long as you still have api access to your hosted redash.io based instance you can still initiate the migration. If I understand correctly it will be no longer possible in 15 days.
The content has some marketing fluff around it explaining about the hossted service but you can get a hang of the idea of how to use redash-toolbelt to migrate your data with some screenshots in blog post.

            <p>Thanks for this! The official redash-toolbelt instructions are also available <a href="https://github.com/getredash/redash-toolbelt/tree/master/redash_toolbelt/docs/redash-migrate">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note: The EOL announcement indicated 30 November as the last date to migrate. Continued API access is incidental and not guaranteed. IIRC correctly the services will go offline later this week, maybe sooner.</p>
