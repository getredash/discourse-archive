    <title>How to enable redash user&#39;s to use newly merged datasource option</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/how-to-enable-redash-users-to-use-newly-merged-datasource-option/9435</link>
    <description>Hi,
I have added a new query_runner firebolt.py(firebolt is a datasource). The PR is merged. Probably this will be included in next version of redash release.
Followings are my questions
1. While we wait for another release, can you provide instructions for how a customer would upgrade an existing Redash instance off of master?
2. how the release process for Redash works? I’d like Redash to make another release so that the new connector is included.</description>

            <p>I’ll respond to this over on github where you asked the same question <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=10" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I think a better option would be for your customer to simply install the one query runner rather than running off of the V11 pre-alpha which is not guaranteed to be stable at all.</p>
