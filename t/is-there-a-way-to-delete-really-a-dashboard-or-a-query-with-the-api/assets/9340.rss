    <title>Is there a way to delete (really) a dashboard or a query with the API?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/is-there-a-way-to-delete-really-a-dashboard-or-a-query-with-the-api/9340</link>
    <description>Hello everybody,

I am using redash, and redash-toolbelt.
However, the API only allow to archive a dashboard and we cannot force the delete.

This feature has some consequences with the URL of the dashboard which is still blocked.

Is there a way with the API to really remove the dashboard ?</description>
