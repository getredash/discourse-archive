    <title>Query in queue even with V10.0</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/query-in-queue-even-with-v10-0/9910</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary
I successfully setting up Redash and connect to Postgres. Everything seems fine when I make some simple query (SELECT * FROM ...), but with more complex ones (built-in functions), Redash just shows &quot;query in queue&quot; and get stuck there forever. I have tried many recommended configuration (increase number of workers, remove queue...), but can&#39;t still make it work.


### Technical details:

* Redash Version: 10.0.0.b50363
* Browser/OS: Chrome
* How did you install Redash: via Helm-chart</description>

            <p>Kubernetes deployments are not officially supported (but will be eventually). You might have better luck raising an issue on the helm_chart repo. It’s not something we maintain.</p>
<p>That said, when queries aren’t executing it usually means that either your workers are not running, or they are not watching the correct queues.</p>
<p>This can happen if you have more than one instance of <code>redis</code> running in your deployment. So the first thing I would check is that you have one, and only one, instance of redis.</p>
