    <title>Migration Support - Dashboards and Queries</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/migration-support-dashboards-and-queries/9832</link>
    <description>Hi Redash team,

Today I tried logging in to [app.redash.io] and the page was not working. I am a new addition to my team hence I didn’t know that [app.redash.io]will stop working. I needed access to queries and dashboards which might not have been migrated from our database. How can that be done? Need immediate help!

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Happy cake day <a class="mention" href="https://discuss.redash.io/u/justinclift">@justinclift</a> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=12" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://discuss.redash.io/u/pcneha">@pcneha</a> Justin is correct that <a href="http://app.redash.io">app.redash.io</a> has been discontinued and the data wiped away. You should speak with someone in your company’s IT department about how to proceed. Many, many customers of <a href="http://app.redash.io">app.redash.io</a> migrated to a self-hosted instance of Redash. Others switched to a separate product entirely. Your IT department should have the most accurate information.</p>

            <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>As far as I know, the old <a href="http://app.redash.io" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">app.redash.io</a> is now all offline, with the data gone.</p>
<p>They gave a <em>lot</em> of advance notice about it (several months), and stopped billing people while a while ago as well.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this is a case where your team did migrate to a new hosting place (internal, or one of the hosting providers), and you just need to find the new Redash address being used. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=11" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
