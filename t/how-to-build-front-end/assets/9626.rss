    <title>How to build front-end?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/how-to-build-front-end/9626</link>
    <description>Hi,

In order to add custom choropleth maps, I made a couple modifications to the front-end code both in `client/app/` and in `viz-lib/`. I followed instructions [here](https://redash.io/help/open-source/dev-guide/docker) to install a docker-based developer environment, and was able to get the change working in the frontend served with `yarn start` (on the `8080` port, while the `5000` port serves the docker container frontend).

I would like to build the `redash` image again, with the modified front-end code, so that I can simply launch the app with `docker-compose up`. I tried commenting out these lines in the `docker-compose.yml`:
```
x-redash-service: &amp;redash-service
  build:
    context: .
    #args:
    #  skip_frontend_build: &quot;true&quot;
```
So that running `docker-compose build` actually builds the frontend as well (`yarn --frozen-lockfile` and `yarn build`) when making the images. But the new containers don&#39;t seem to reflect the changes: after `docker-compose up`, the `5000` port still shows the old frontend.

Any advice on how to do this ?

Note: if I look inside the `redash_server` container, I do see the added/modified files !

(ps: it would be awesome to revive [this issue](https://github.com/getredash/redash/pull/4599))</description>
