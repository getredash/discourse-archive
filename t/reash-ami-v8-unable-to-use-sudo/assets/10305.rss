    <title>Reash AMI v8 - Unable to use `sudo`</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/reash-ami-v8-unable-to-use-sudo/10305</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary

Hi,
The private IP of the instance has changed from what it was originally. Now I&#39;m unable to run any `sudo` commands because the host is not in the `/etc/hosts` file (and I cannot edit the file because I can&#39;t run `sudo`). 

I&#39;ve read that I should be able to edit the file if I use the `root` user, but it asks for a password (which is not set when launching the instance from AMI). 

Basically, I&#39;ve narrowed down my 504 error to the instance host not being the `/etc/hosts` file, and I&#39;m trying to figure out how to add it on there. It seems stopping and starting the instance is what changed the private IP of the instance, but did not update the hosts file.

Thank you in advance!

### Technical details:

* Redash Version: v8
* Browser/OS: Ubuntu
* How did you install Redash: AMI</description>
