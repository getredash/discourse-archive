    <title>Disk is full in the Redash server which was setup with docker</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/disk-is-full-in-the-redash-server-which-was-setup-with-docker/9615</link>
    <description>We are facing disk storage full issue with Redash docker setup.
How we can clean the cache or unnecessary data. Since we couldn&#39;t extend the hard disk storage every time when growing redash data.

And I have find the exact same issue reported already here.
http://discuss.redash.io/t/docker-issue-with-disk-being-full/8496
But there was no solution for that.


* Redash Version: 8.0.0+b32245

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://discuss.redash.io/u/jesse">@jesse</a> for the reply.<br>
We don’t have much query on our side…<br>
Currently we are using only around 15-20 queries. So I don’t think these query having 8GB of query results.</p>
<p>Anyway I’ll check the queries once again and I’ll take a look on the job process you have mentioned.</p>
<p>And get back to you if I found anything.<br>
Thanks!!</p>

            <p>There’s really two questions here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Redash should automatically clear out your old query results with a periodic job. Is this job running? And if not, why not? In general, the query result cache shouldn’t continue growing unless your <em>usage</em>  is also increasing. More likely, this job is not running. Here’s a description of the job from the source code:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-python">"""
Job to cleanup unused query results -- such that no query links to them anymore, and older than
    settings.QUERY_RESULTS_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE (a week by default, so it's less likely to be open in someone's browser and be used).

    Each time the job deletes only settings.QUERY_RESULTS_CLEANUP_COUNT (100 by default) query results so it won't choke
    the database in case of many such results.
"""
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>If the job is not running, it’s either a configuration problem (i.e. something you need to fix) or it’s a bug (something the community needs to fix).</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I can’t reproduce this behavior on V10.1 I assume it’s either a bug that we squashed (intentionally or not) in the three years since V8 was released, or you have misconfigured your instance.</p>
<p>I’d advise anyone to update from V8 to V10.1 since we’re not supporting V8 anymore.</p>

I tried accessing my hosted Redash instance the other day and got an Internal Server Error. When I tried running Docker commands it gives me: [23955] INTERNAL ERROR: cannot create temporary directory! Upon Google search, it was because my disk was full and I solved the issue by running docker system prune --all. My questions: 

Is there a way of preventing this in the future? This has actually happened the 2nd time now and both times the downtime caught me by surprise.
Does this h…
