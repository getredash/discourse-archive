            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We did not manage to restore the previous version up. However, we had a copy of it (the copy where the queries were visible but we could not run it). So a new instance, completely new was made and each function in the company has had to restore their previous queries using the old instance.</p>
<p>The current new redash version is: * Version: 8.0.0+b32245 (a16f551e)</p>

            <p>Can you provide any further details about your setup? Which version of Redash? Did you manage to restore your database after deleting files from the postgres folder?</p>
