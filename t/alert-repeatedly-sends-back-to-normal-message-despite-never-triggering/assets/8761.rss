    <title>Alert repeatedly sends &quot;back to normal&quot; message despite never triggering</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/alert-repeatedly-sends-back-to-normal-message-despite-never-triggering/8761</link>
    <description>Hello all :).

I&#39;ve got a scheduled query that runs every minute and produces a single scalar value. I&#39;ve created an alert based on that query with the following settings:
- trigger said value is `&lt; 65000`
- notifications are sent &quot;just once, until back to normal&quot;
- slack channel set up as alert destination
- custom description that includes the {{ALERT_STATUS}} and {{QUERY_RESULT_VALUE}} macros (for debugging purposes).

I&#39;m seeing two kinds of strange behavior:

* Often (but unfortunately for our debugging purposes, not *always*) the slack channel will receive a message every minute saying &quot;{{ALERT_NAME}} went back to normal}}&quot;, coupled with an &quot;OK&quot; status and a value that is clearly above the 65000 alert threshold. These messages even when the alert was not recently in a &quot;TRIGGERED&quot; state. Put another way, the slack channel multiple &quot;back to normal&quot; messages for a single &quot;triggered&quot; message, if a &quot;triggered&quot; message appears at all.
* This behavior persists if I tell the alert to send notifications &quot;at most every 5 minutes&quot;. The only difference is that the green notifications are sent every 5 minutes instead of every minute when the underlying query refreshes.

Other troubleshooting steps I&#39;ve tried:
* I&#39;ve debugged the underlying query to the point that I&#39;m pretty confident it&#39;s not returning values below the threshold for brief periods of time. The query computes rolling average anyways, so that kind of behavior shouldn&#39;t happy given what I know about the underlying timeseries it&#39;s pulling from. Plus, wouldn&#39;t I see a red &quot;triggered&quot; message in slack if the alert entered the &quot;triggered&quot; state?
* I&#39;ve tried creating a new query and alert with the same query text, refresh rate, and alert settings and the same problem exists.

Questions:
* Any other troubleshooting steps I should try?
* Any other ways I could configure this alert to stop this behavior?

Relevant platform information:
* self-hosted redash

            <p>Yes absolutely this would cause that kind of issue.</p>
<p>The postgres database contains <em>all</em> of Redash’s state. I’m actually surprised that this works with the same backing database. As there are significant database schema differences between those versions <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=10" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>
<p>Try disabling the alert on one of the instances and see if the issue resolves.</p>

            <p>We upgraded to V10 and observed the same behavior (“triggered” and “ok” notifications deliver repeatedly every time the alert is evaluated instead of once when the state changes).</p>
<p>One thing I am wondering though: we are actually running two redash instances. One is on v10 (as of today), and the other is on V8 (specifically <code>redash/redash:8.0.0.b32245</code>). They share the same backing postgres database. Do you think it’s possible that the two services are interfering with each other in some way?</p>
<p>Happy to try any other debugging strategies you think might be helpful.</p>

</aside>
<p>Very interesting. I wonder if the jobs aren’t being updated in redis so the alert is picked up twice (or more).</p>
<p>Very curious to hear the result of trying this with V10.</p>

<p>Good to know. For reference, upon subsequent testing of the “just once, until back to normal setting”, we saw both TRIGGERED <strong>AND</strong> OK messages delivering multiple times, each time the underlying query was evaluated.</p>

<p>Not sure, but I’m happy to try!</p>

</aside>
<p>For clarification, this setting “at most every 5 minutes” only affects the frequency of TRIGGERED messages. You will always receive a notification when the alert is first triggered and you will always receive <strong>one</strong> notification when the value goes back to normal. You shouldn’t see multiple back-to-normal notifications, though, so this does look like a bug.</p>
<p>Does this reproduce using the V10 beta?</p>
