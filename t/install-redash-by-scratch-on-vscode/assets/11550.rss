    <title>Install Redash by scratch on VScode</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/install-redash-by-scratch-on-vscode/11550</link>
    <description>I setup Kubernetes in VS Studio, Repo was added and Rancher Desktop is working properly.  My  next step is to create Username and Password file in some Redash directory and then run a helm install from that directory.  Any tips on how I can create this? I&#39;m new to Redash and Kubernetes.  

I had issues trying to setup through Ubuntu.

TIA</description>
