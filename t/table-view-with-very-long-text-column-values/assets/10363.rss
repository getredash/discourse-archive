    <title>Table view with very long text column values</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/table-view-with-very-long-text-column-values/10363</link>
    <description>I have a table with a column that typically contains pretty long text in it. This makes the table view pretty unwieldy as-is. I want the column visible, because I need the search capabilities of it and the end user wants to be able to read it. But is it possible to truncate the text to a a few visible lines and use a hover/tool tip to display all of it? I&#39;m open to other suggestions as well.

Thanks!</description>
