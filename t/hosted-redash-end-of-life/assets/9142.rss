    <description>Hi,
I have seen that redash is about to close app.redash.io. Is it really going to happen?
I have done a lot of work on redash.io. I know they have given a method to save my reports but where they are going to shift. I mean what will happen to my redash reports.
Thanks</description>

            <p>Hi there, yes Hosted Redash will be discontinued on 30 November 2021. After that date you will not be able to login at <a href="http://app.redash.io">app.redash.io</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple options going forward:</p>
<p>If you would like to continue using Redash, you can deploy a copy of it on your own server. Weâ€™ve just released V10 of Redash and will provide a script in the coming days to move your data from <a href="http://app.redash.io">app.redash.io</a> to your own server.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to move forward with a different tool, you can also simply export your queries as text files and use them in whatever SQL tool you prefer.</p>
