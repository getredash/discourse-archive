    <title>DB Fiddle -- Useful when answering questions here</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/db-fiddle-useful-when-answering-questions-here/9350</link>
    <description>Check out db-fiddle.com

It&#39;s a web app that lets you execute SQL against different database engines with no login required.

I thought I&#39;d share since this was a huge help to me when writing answers on the forum. I figure out how to solve the problem in my database of choice (Postgres) but I can use DB Fiddle to experiment with SQLite and MySQL and make sure my code samples are good.

Before DB Fiddle I would spin up a docker container for this, which was time-consuming.</description>
