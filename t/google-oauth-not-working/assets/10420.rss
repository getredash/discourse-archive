    <title>Google OAuth Not Working</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/google-oauth-not-working/10420</link>
    <description>I have set up a redash instance using the provide AMI for us-east-1 and wanting to set up Google OAuth. I followed the steps listed here: https://redash.io/help/open-source/setup#aws, as well as setting up a google cloud project listed here: https://redash.io/help/open-source/admin-guide/google-developer-account-setup. I have restarted the web server with `docker-compose up -d server`, but the traditional login to redash with your email and password is still popping up. I have tried to restart this a few times but getting nowhere. Any advice would be appreciated</description>

<p>Ended up solving this issue, was a cookie/cache issue and had to look at the logs to see that the redirect URI was different than what I was expecting</p>
