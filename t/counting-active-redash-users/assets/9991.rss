    <title>Counting active redash users?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/counting-active-redash-users/9991</link>
    <description>### Issue Summary
We are trying to keep a count of active users within our organization to see who uses Redash. 

We found this PR https://github.com/getredash/redash/pull/1214 and it seems like the PR was closed with no action taken because analytics won&#39;t track page changes.
In our case, we don&#39;t care about tracking page changes. We care about counting active users the first time they use Redash in a session.

How should we be setting up Google analytics to track Redash usage? Any ideas/thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

### Technical details:
* Redash Version: 9</description>
