    <title>What to do about hundreds of CVE reported by scanning Redash Container?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/what-to-do-about-hundreds-of-cve-reported-by-scanning-redash-container/10523</link>
    <description>Our team has been managing a Redash environment for some time now and we&#39;ve recently enabled some security scanning features which have identified an alarming number of issues in Containers run from the Redash Images published in Docker Hub.  I believe that these aren&#39;t actually Redash issues, but are inherited from the chosen base Image and thus a resolution for all of these could be trivial.  Hopefully some Redash admins will join.

As I mentioned, we recently enabled a Container scanner which our company&#39;s security team has provided for us.  That scanner identified **hundreds** of Critical/High vulnerabilities in Containers built from **redash:10.1.0.b50633**.  These are real legitimate CVE, which are found in libraries installed in the Container, not in Redash itself.

As a test, I scanned a Container based on **node:14.17**, which I can see Redash uses as a base Image.  The scanner again identified hundreds of issues.  

I then scanned a Container based on **node:14-alpine** and it found 0 Critical/High vulnerabilities!  

@arikfr - do you guys scan Redash Containers that are built from the Images published to Docker Hub?  If so, are you also seeing hundreds of Critical/High CVE?  If so, what are the plans to resolve these?

As far as I can see (which is admittedly, not everywhere) there are *a lot* of issues here which are inherited from **node** that can easily be avoided.  There&#39;s not any easy way to resolve these issues downstream.  Fixing them in the published Redash Images would help tremendously.

I&#39;ve reported this topic to the Redash security team, but I&#39;m posting here as well for the benefit of others who may be facing the same issue in their scans.</description>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="https://discuss.redash.io/u/jesse">@jesse</a>, here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/phillipjohnson/290412e8c4291dcd23e320c981f96867" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">a gist of the Dockerfile</a> I’ve been playing with. The most significant thing is changing from buster to bullseye.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the bump. I’m seeing if we can spec out the time to prioritise this next quarter.</p>
<p>If you have a public repository with a successful upgrade of the OS we’d love to see this / incorporate it into the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

            <p>Bumping this to see if there’s any sort of official path forward from the Redash team.</p>

            <p>This is a great question, I created a <a href="https://github.com/getredash/docker/issues/13" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub issue</a> a few months ago about it too. I’ve successfully built my own redash image on an updated OS, but we are not yet running that in production. I was able to clear out all the vulnerabilities in the OS except for some <code>curl</code> problems that are still not patched.</p>
<p>However, there are some Python vulnerabilities in redash that we can’t patch on our own. I have <a href="http://discuss.redash.io/t/vulnerabilities-in-python-dependencies/10321">reported those here</a>. I realize this is not as straightforward as it likely involves code updates.</p>
