    <title>Admin role inside group</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/admin-role-inside-group/3958</link>
    <description>Hello,

It will be very helpful to be able to allow users that are not admin to change the permissions of other  users&#39; queries from the same group.

The problem is that users from one group build dashboards/queries and the rest of the group can&#39;t edit/change it if needed.

General solution:
Maybe it can be implemented like additional built-in group (e.x. `sub_group_admin`).
In case if current user is added to this group (manually of course) so current user can edit all dashboards/queries of other users from all groups (except built-in ones) to which current user belongs to.

Solution by groups:
It can be implemented per group, but in this case current user should have another property (like `permissions.group_admin = true` or `group_admin = true`).</description>

            <p>This wasn’t implemented. But we have it in mind to rework the permissions model for Redash. We’ll announce on the forum once we start work on this so we can solicit feedback from contributors.</p>
