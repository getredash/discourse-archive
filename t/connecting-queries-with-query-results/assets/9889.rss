    <title>Connecting queries with query_results</title>
    <link>https://discuss.redash.io/t/connecting-queries-with-query-results/9889</link>
    <description>Im trying to fetch specific queries and to get their query results for auditing.
I tried using both query_hash and last_quer_data_id to join both tables but I always get very partial results. A lot of times the queries doesnt have a corresponding query_result entry although I know they were ran

Thanks for your help</description>
